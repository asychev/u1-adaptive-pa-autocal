# U1 Adaptive PA AutoCal — User Guide

Macros in [`adaptive_pa_macro.cfg`](../adaptive_pa_macro.cfg) help build an **OrcaSlicer Adaptive Pressure Advance** table using the Snapmaker U1's stock `FLOW_MEASURE_K` command (pure-E velocity steps + toolhead flow residual). **No Klipper Python changes are required.**

Rather than slicing, printing, and visually scoring **5 to 10+ calibration prints** per toolhead (as recommended in [OrcaSlicer's Adaptive PA guide](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/wiki/adaptive_pressure_advance_calib)), these macros streamline calibration in two key ways:

1. **Automated Sensor Measurement:** Uses the U1's inductance flow sensor to measure extrusion pressure residuals directly in a non-printing test run (eliminating bed heating, printed line inspection, and manual scoring).
2. **Reduced Test Count (Box-Style Methodology):** Uses Box-style response surface sampling (4 envelope corners plus 1 center point) to accurately map the full operating envelope in just 5 smart test points instead of an exhaustive grid search.

For a 4-toolhead U1, this replaces **20 to 40+ individual calibration prints** with a fast, sensor-driven process to generate your OrcaSlicer table rows:

```text
PA, flow_mm3_s, accel_mm_s2
```

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before running the calibration, ensure:

1. **Working Flow Sensor:** U1 with `[flow_calibrator]` and operational inductance-based flow sensing.
2. **Loaded Filament & Clean Nozzle:** Target filament loaded on the tool you wish to test, nozzle clean of debris for purges.
3. **Idle Printer at Printing Temp:** Machine idle (not printing) heated to your filament's standard printing temperature (e.g., PLA at 220 °C).
4. **Include Macro File:** Add the macro to `printer.cfg` and restart Klipper:

```ini
[include adaptive_pa_macro.cfg]
```

*On paxx12 extended firmware, put the file in `config/extended/klipper/` instead — that folder is included automatically. U1 firmware updates rewrite `printer.cfg` and drop your own `[include]` lines.*

---

## 2. Automated Run (recommended)

[`scripts/apa_autocal.py`](../scripts/apa_autocal.py) runs the suite from a computer on the same network and does all of Step 2 and Step 3 below for you. It:

* runs each test point through `APA_COIL_CELL` and reads the `area` lines from Moonraker as they arrive,
* finds the sign flip, computes $K^*$ and the confidence score exactly like `APA_FINISH_CELL` (and also runs `APA_FINISH_CELL`, so the result shows up in the Fluidd/Mainsail console),
* re-runs a point with the K range moved when every `area` has the same sign (up to `--max-retries`, default 2),
* re-runs a point with a fine `0.001` step between the bracket ends when confidence is below 45 (`--refine-below`),
* prints the OrcaSlicer rows and the median fallback PA, and saves everything to `apa_results/<timestamp>/`,
* turns the nozzle heater off when a tool is done (`FLOW_MEASURE_K` leaves it at 170 °C).

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) there is nothing to install — replace `python3` with `uv run` in the commands below (`uv run scripts/apa_autocal.py ...`) and uv fetches Python and `websockets` on first use. Otherwise:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt     # websockets is the only package the tool needs

# Check the printer and print the plan (no heating, no motion)
python3 scripts/apa_autocal.py --host PRINTER_IP --tools 0 --dry-run

# Full suite on T0 at 220 °C
python3 scripts/apa_autocal.py --host PRINTER_IP --tools 0 --temp 220

# All tools, without the stress corner
python3 scripts/apa_autocal.py --host PRINTER_IP --tools 0,1,2,3 --temp 220 --skip-stress
```

Set the envelope on the printer first (presets, `APA_COIL_SET_ENVELOPE`); the tool reads it from `_APA_COIL_CFG`. Example summary:

```text
=== T0  220 C ===
point        speed  accel   flow  K*     conf  grade     notes
low_anchor     100   2000   8.14  0.017    87  excellent
high_flow      250   2000  20.35  0.047    86  excellent
...
--- OrcaSlicer: Filament > Adaptive pressure advance measurements ---
0.017, 8.14, 2000
0.047, 20.35, 2000
...
Fallback static Pressure advance (median K*): 0.017
```

Rows graded *weak* or *unusable* (confidence below 45) are left out of the Orca block and listed underneath. Per-tool rows are also saved as `orca_T<n>.txt`; `results.json` keeps every sweep, and `console.log` the console output (temperature reports filtered out).

| Option | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `--points center,high_flow` | Run only some points |
| `--resume apa_results/<timestamp>` | Continue an interrupted session; finished points are kept |
| `--parse-log console.txt` | Offline: finish points from a console log saved from Fluidd/Mainsail (no printer needed) |
| `--api-key KEY` | Only if Moonraker requires one for your network |

Pressing Ctrl+C stops the tool, but the point that is already running finishes on the printer — cancel it from Fluidd/Mainsail if needed.

---

## 3. Manual Walkthrough (3 Steps)

Calibrating a toolhead takes about 25 minutes using the automated 5-point test suite. Use these steps when running the suite from Fluidd, Mainsail or the touchscreen without the script.

### Step 1: Run the automated test suite

To run the complete 5-point calibration suite on a single toolhead, execute:

```gcode
APA_COIL_RUN_ALL EXTRUDER=0 TEMP=220
```

*(Or run all toolheads sequentially: `APA_COIL_RUN_ALL_TOOLS TOOLS=0,1,2,3 TEMP=220`)*

The printer automatically selects the specified tool, heats the nozzle to temperature, and runs the entire 5-point test suite in one continuous pass.

---

### Step 2: Read the log output and run finish commands

After `APA_COIL_RUN_ALL` completes, review your console log. Each of the 5 test points prints a block of `k` values followed by a `MEASURE DONE` banner.

For each test point block:
1. Find the pair of lines where `area` **flips from positive to negative**:

```text
// k0.010: area=12450.000
// k0.015: area=5128.000
// k0.020: area=-5281.000
// k0.025: area=-11800.000
```

2. Copy the template command printed in that test point's `MEASURE DONE` banner (which includes `FLOW`, `ACCEL`, and `NAME`) and fill in `K0`, `A0`, `K1`, and `A1`:

```gcode
APA_FINISH_CELL K0=0.015 A0=5128 K1=0.020 A1=-5281 FLOW=8.14 ACCEL=2000 NAME=low_anchor MAX_ABS=12450
```

*(Note: If you run test points individually or process the very last point immediately after it finishes, you can use the shortcut `APA_FINISH_LAST K0=0.015 A0=5128 K1=0.020 A1=-5281`. When reviewing prior points in the log after the full suite finishes, use `APA_FINISH_CELL` as shown above).*

*Tip: `area` flips from positive (K too low) to negative (K too high). `MAX_ABS=` takes the largest absolute sensor magnitude from that sweep (always entered as a positive number, e.g., `MAX_ABS=12450`), which allows the macro to grade signal-to-noise ratio. Scoring details: [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md#signal-quality--confidence-scoring-algorithm).*

---

### Step 3: Copy the line into OrcaSlicer

`APA_FINISH_LAST` calculates the exact zero-crossing Pressure Advance ($K^*$) and outputs a paste-ready row:

```text
========== APA FINISH: low_anchor ==========
Bracket: k=0.015 area=5128  ->  k=0.020 area=-5281
K* (zero cross): 0.017463...  ->  rounded 0.017
Confidence: 83/100 (excellent) | good signal | bracket_balance=0.985...
--- copy/paste into Orca Adaptive PA ---
0.017, 8.14, 2000
----------------------------------------
```

Repeat **Step 2** for each of the 5 test points. Copy all 5 output rows into OrcaSlicer:

**Filament Settings $\rightarrow$ Enable adaptive pressure advance $\rightarrow$ Adaptive pressure advance measurements**

---

## 4. Presets & Envelope Tuning

Default geometry and speed/acceleration envelopes are configured in `_APA_COIL_CFG`:

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Nozzle / Layer Height / Line Width | 0.4 / 0.2 / 0.45 mm |
| Filament Diameter | 1.75 mm (filament area 2.405282 mm², ratio 0.033849) |
| Line Area ($A_{\text{line}}$) | 0.081416 mm² |
| Flow ($Q = v_{\text{XY}} \cdot A_{\text{line}}$) | Calculated automatically |
| Speeds (low / mid / high) | **100 / 200 / 250** mm/s |
| Accels (low / mid / high) | **2000 / 6000 / 10000** mm/s² |

The 5 test points evaluate your machine across this operating envelope:

| Test Point | XY Speed | XY Accel | Volumetric Flow ($Q$) | Role |
|------------|----------|----------|-----------------------|------|
| `low_anchor` | 100 mm/s | 2000 mm/s² | ~8.1 mm³/s | Low flow at HQ outer wall acceleration |
| `high_flow` | 250 mm/s | 2000 mm/s² | ~20.4 mm³/s | High flow at soft acceleration |
| `high_force` | 100 mm/s | 10000 mm/s² | ~8.1 mm³/s | Low flow at inner wall / infill acceleration |
| `stress` | 250 mm/s | 10000 mm/s² | ~20.4 mm³/s | Combined high flow + high acceleration |
| `center` | 200 mm/s | 6000 mm/s² | ~16.3 mm³/s | Mid-point print condition |

---

### Envelope Presets

You can easily select standard envelope presets before running `APA_COIL_RUN_ALL`:

```gcode
# Standard Orca profile HQ defaults (100-250 mm/s, 2k-10k accel)
APA_COIL_PRESET_DEFAULT

# Normal outer (4k) to inner (10k) acceleration profile
APA_COIL_PRESET_ORCA_NORMAL

# Quality mode: constant single acceleration (default 2000 mm/s²)
APA_COIL_PRESET_SHAPER_QUALITY ACCEL=2000

# High-flow nozzle preset (wider speed range)
APA_COIL_PRESET_HIGH_FLOW LOW_SPEED=150 HIGH_SPEED=300

# Fully custom envelope
APA_COIL_SET_ENVELOPE LOW_SPEED=120 HIGH_SPEED=280 LOW_ACCEL=4000 HIGH_ACCEL=8000

# Other nozzle / layer: line area and ratio are computed for you
APA_COIL_SET_ENVELOPE LAYER_HEIGHT=0.3 LINE_WIDTH=0.62 FIL_DIA=1.75
```

`LAYER_HEIGHT`, `LINE_WIDTH` and `FIL_DIA` default to 0.2 / 0.45 / 1.75 when only some are given. `LINE_AREA=` / `RATIO=` still set the values directly.

---

### Speed Limit Check (Filament Flow Ceiling)

Do not set `HIGH_SPEED` faster than your hotend and filament can melt. Testing faster than your hotend can flow will cause clicking, under-extrusion, or test failures.

**How to calculate your maximum safe speed:**
1. Check your filament's **Max Volumetric Speed** in OrcaSlicer (e.g., `16.3 mm³/s` for standard PLA).
2. Divide that number by **0.0814** (the standard line area for a 0.4 mm nozzle at 0.2 mm layer height).

$$\text{Max Speed (mm/s)} = \frac{\text{Max Volumetric Speed}}{0.0814}$$

*Example:*  
If your filament is rated for **16.3 mm³/s**:
$$\text{Max Speed} = \frac{16.3}{0.0814} \approx 200\text{ mm/s}$$

Set `HIGH_SPEED=200` (or lower) so your test points remain within your hotend's flow limits.

Or let the macro do it — `MVS=` caps `HIGH_SPEED` at MVS ÷ line area (and pulls the mid speed back inside the range if needed):

```gcode
APA_COIL_SET_ENVELOPE MVS=16.3
APA: HIGH_SPEED 250.0 exceeds MVS 16.3 mm3/s, capped to 200.2
```

---

### Time and Filament Costs

With default envelope settings and standard scan parameters (7 steps per point):

| Scope | Time (approx.) | Filament Usage (approx., 1.75 mm PLA) |
|-------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Single test point** | ~5 minutes | ~3–5 g |
| **Full suite (1 tool, 5 points)** | ~25 minutes | ~20 g (~5 m) |
| **All 4 toolheads (`RUN_ALL_TOOLS`)** | ~1.5 to 2 hours | ~80 g |

*Tip: Pass `SKIP_STRESS=1` to `APA_COIL_RUN_ALL` if your hotend cannot sustain high speed at maximum acceleration. This saves ~5 minutes and ~4 grams of filament.*

---

### Choosing Fallback Static PA

OrcaSlicer requires a single static **Pressure advance** value to use when Adaptive PA is disabled or unmapped.

**Simple 3-Step Recipe:**
1. Collect the calculated $K^*$ values for all good test points.
2. Sort the values from smallest to largest.
3. Take the **median value** (the middle number) and enter it as your main filament Pressure Advance in OrcaSlicer.

*Example:* For $K^*$ values of `0.012, 0.013, 0.016, 0.017, 0.023`, the median is **0.016**.

---

### Advanced Operations & Custom Test Points

Re-run an individual point or perform fine-resolution scans around a suspected root:

```gcode
# Select tool
APA_SELECT_TOOL EXTRUDER=0

# Run a single test point from the envelope on the active tool
# (add EXTRUDER=n to switch tools first)
APA_COIL_HIGH_FLOW MODE=MEASURE TEMP=220

# Run a custom fine-step scan around K=0.025
APA_COIL_CELL NAME=fine_flow SPEED=200 ACCEL=6000 MIN=0.020 MAX=0.030 STEP=0.002

# Format a known K directly into an Orca line without interpolation
APA_ORCA_LINE K=0.024 FLOW=16.28 ACCEL=6000 NAME=manual_entry
```

## 5. Troubleshooting & Command Reference

### Troubleshooting Guide

| Symptom | Probable Cause | Recommended Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Unknown command: "APA_COIL_1"` | Digits in macro name | Use named macro like `APA_COIL_LOW_ANCHOR`. |
| `Unknown command: "APA_COIL_RUN_ALL"` after a firmware update | Update rewrote `printer.cfg` and dropped the `[include]` | Re-add it, or on paxx12 firmware move the file to `config/extended/klipper/`. |
| `apa_autocal.py` stops with "no sign flip" | $K^*$ far outside the range even after retries | Raise `--max-retries` or set a different `k_min`/`k_max` in `_APA_COIL_CFG`. |
| `extruder ... not activated` | Active tool mismatch | Run `APA_SELECT_TOOL EXTRUDER=n`. |
| All `area` values have the same sign | $K^*$ is outside current scan range | Widen `MIN` or `MAX` search bounds. |
| Low `area` magnitudes (~hundreds) | Weak excitation signal (low speed) | Point has weak SNR, do not overfit. |
| Stress test point clicks or skips | Hotend flow rate exceeded | Use `SKIP_STRESS=1` or lower `HIGH_SPEED`. |
| Macro template error in `.cfg` | Inline `#` character in macro body | Remove `#` from Jinja or `gcode:` blocks. |
| Coil CSV shorter than the test / missing later $K$ combs | Downloaded while async `FREQUENCY_MEASURE` write still running | Re-download full file from Fluidd `gcodes/frequency_data/` (see [COIL_DATA_CAPTURE.md](COIL_DATA_CAPTURE.md)). |
